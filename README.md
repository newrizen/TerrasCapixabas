## Meaning

"Terras Capixabas" means Capixabas' Lands, or to be more specific, Lands of the Capixaba people/place (in this case, all stuff and people from the state of Espirito Santo).
The word Capixaba has its origins in the indigenous word "kopi'xawa", from Tupi, which means land for plantation or where there is plantation, a 'countryside'.

*In Brazil, it is widely known as a gentilic for the people of Espirito Santo, but it is also the name of a city in the Brazilian state of Acre.
