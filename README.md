## Meaning

"Terras Capixabas" means Capixabas' Lands, or to be more specific, Lands of the Capixaba people/place (in this case, all stuff and people from the state of Espirito Santo).
The word Capixaba has its origins in the indigenous word "kopi'xawa", from Tupi, which means land for plantation or where there is plantation, a 'countryside'.

*In Brazil, it is widely known as a gentilic for the people of Espirito Santo, but it is also the name of a city in the Brazilian state of Acre.

## The Game

## How to Start

To play you need:

- [Luanti](https://www.luanti.org/) a [open source application](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti). so you must first [install Luanti](https://www.luanti.org/en/downloads/) for PC (Windows / Linux) or mobile [Play Story](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.minetest.minetest) and [Fdroid](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.minetest.minetest/) (only available for Android).

- On Luanti, click on '+', 'Games' and download the default game 'Minetest Game'.

- Download the folders from this repository and in the general '.minetest' folder created by Luanti, move the 'Vila_Capixaba' folder into the 'worlds' folder and 'terras_capixabas' into the 'mods' folder.

- Open Luanti (if it was open before placing the folders, close and reopen it to update) and in Minetest Game play the world 'Vila Capixaba'.

*Attention: if you delete the Vila Capixaba world inside or outside of Luanti, you will have to repeat the process of placing the folder in worlds.
**Note: Avoid using creative mode if you don't want to easily destroy things in the world.
